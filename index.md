# AppSec Pipeline Project

![OWASP_Project_Header.jpg](OWASP_Project_Header.jpg "OWASP_Project_Header.jpg")

The OWASP AppSec Rugged DevOps Pipeline Project is the place to find the information you need to increase the
speed and automation of your AppSec program. Using the sample implementation, documentation and references of
this project will allow you to setup your own AppSec Pipeline.

## Description

The AppSec pipeline project is a place to gather together information, techniques and tools to create your own
AppSec Pipeline. AppSec Pipelines takes the principles of DevOps and Lean and applies that to an application
security program. The project will gather references, code, and specific guidance for tools/software which
would compose an AppSec Pipeline.
